# Snake Game in Python

This is a snake game written in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game is played by using the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The goal of the game is to eat as many dots as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail.

Update v1.2: Added a new snake color, change shape of snake food to turtle. Each spawn of the food will be a random color from the color list.

Future Updates: Increasing the speed of the game as it processes, adding event listeners to the WSAD Keys, generate a random RGB color rather than it being from a list

## How to play

Start the game by running the main.py file.
Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
Eat the turtle to score points.
Be careful not to hit the walls or the snake's own tail.
